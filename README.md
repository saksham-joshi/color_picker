# color_picker
During the development of User Interface , we have to work on colors and combinations . That's why i developed "COLOR PICKER" !

Pick colors from a image or from anywhere on your screen and get a whole color pallete .

All you need to do is to install Python 3.11 or above version on your System.

then , type command(for windows) : pip install pyqt5 

That's All .... you are good to go .

Run the file ColorPalette.py
